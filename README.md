# Custom-YOLO-Object-Detection
In this Project I train YOLO to detect objects of my own dataset.
For this Project the Darknet-Framework was used to train the YOLOv3-Network.

I created my own dataset with sensor images. The camera I used was the Intel Realsense D435, but I only used 2D-Images.
The images were labeled with labelImg.
I trained the model with Google Colab.
